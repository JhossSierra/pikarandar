i made this just to practice things im learning.

1. How is it the practice about? (Ok, we know it is CSS but how it looks what you wanted to practice?)
2. Add how to run your code (what commands did you use)
3. Don't add personal sfuff, it looks unproffesional -> "a friend said that i should post the things i make to practice, so... here is it"
4. Take your practices and your efforts serious and proudly. Cheer up buddy!

Whenever you want you can look into my repos to get some inspiration!

Here I add you this link to create better README: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html
Your README files are the presentation of your work, you have to "sell" it!

Keep it up! ðŸ’™
